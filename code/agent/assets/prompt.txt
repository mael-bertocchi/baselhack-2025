I want you to act as a product designer and AI developer for a consensus-building tool for Endress+Hauser. The goal is to help teams gather diverse opinions, analyze them using AI, and generate a meaningful consensus.

Here are the requirements:
- Collect opinions from multiple participants on any topic.
- Use AI to identify common themes, conflicting viewpoints, and areas of agreement.
- Produce a clear summary reflecting the collective wisdom of the group.

Please provide:
- A high-level concept for the tool (web app, bot, mobile app, or something innovative).
- How the AI would analyze and synthesize opinions.
- How users would interact with the system.
- Possible features to make it engaging and inclusive.

Think creatively but focus on making the tool practical for large teams with diverse perspectives.
