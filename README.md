# BaselHack 2025

This repository contains our work for the BaselHack 2025 event. We selected the Endress+Hauser sponsored challenge focused on developing an application to create surveys, gather people's opinions, and analyze the results with AI.

## Project Overview

We have developed the backend with Fastify and the frontend with Flutter. The application allows users to create surveys, distribute them, and analyze the collected data using AI techniques. We also have developed an AI agent to assist users in generating survey questions based on specific topics.
